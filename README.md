# ICRC-2 Token on ICP Testnet

This repository contains the implementation of a token using the ICRC-2 token economics standard, deployed on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) testnet.
Overview

This project demonstrates the creation and deployment of a token adhering to the ICRC-2 token standard on the ICP testnet. The ICRC-2 standard ensures that the token is interoperable with other systems and follows the best practices for token economics.

### Features
- Creation of a token following ICRC-2 standards
- Deployment on the ICP testnet
- Basic operations: minting, transferring, burning tokens
- Implementation of token economics

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Rust and Cargo installed on your machine
- Internet Computer SDK (dfx) installed
- Node.js and npm installed (for running local environment)
- An account on the ICP testnet
